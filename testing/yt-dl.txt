This is a user manual full of tips and tricks for yt-dl 2.2.0.0

GUI5:
    Audio:
        # downloads a video and converts it to mp3 using ffmpeg (should support any webpage)

        url bar: takes url to video

        use cookies: lets you download your private videos (if you supply cookies.txt)

        playlist toggle: playlist yes/now

        playlist bar:  for example: 1-3,7,9

        download: starts download

        open: open folder with downloaded files

    Video:
        # downloads a video, and if necessary uses ffmpeg to merge

        url bar: takes url to video

        use cookies: lets you download your private videos (if you supply cookies.txt)

        playlist toggle: playlist yes/no (tested even with custom but don't see the point of it, but it works)

        playlist bar:  for example: 1-3,7,9

        download: starts download

        open: open folder with downloaded files

        List quality: lists available video and audio options to use with custom (can only list for one video and that will be fist video in playlist)

        Best: bestaudio+bestvideo (merged by ffmpeg) ! does not work on all webpages

        Normal: best ! gives low quality on youtube, but good quality on other sites

        Custom: lets you input quality values from <List quality>

        if no quality is selected <Best> is used, so most webpages will fail to download, but youtube will in best quality

    Subs:
        # downloads subtitles in .vtt format and converts them to .srt (only tested on youtube)

        url bar: takes url to video

        use cookies: lets you download your private videos (if you supply cookies.txt)

        playlist toggle: playlist yes/no (didn't really test it with custom, because I don't know if videos have reliably same en subtitle)

        playlist bar:  for example: 1-3,7,9

        download: starts download

        open: open folder with downloaded files

        List lang: lists available subtitle languages

        Lang bar: you can type languages you say in <List lang> or type all to download all subtitles

    Re-encode:
        # not refactored yet.
